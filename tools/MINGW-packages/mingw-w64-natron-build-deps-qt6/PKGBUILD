  # Clang is needed by shiboken2 for now because shiboken2 can't seem to find g++. It appears
  # shiboken2 includes hard-coded paths to the g++ binary that is used when shiboken2 is built for msys2.
  # Remove this dependency when the shiboken2 package is fixed so it works w/o clang or updates its pkg deps.
  # The following change to msys2 made adding this clang dependency necessary.
